"""Drives weight sync rounds across the orchestrator's worker registry.

`WeightSyncHandler` knows how to talk to a transport; it does not know who the
participants are. This module supplies that half: it looks workers up by role
in the `WorkerRegistry`, collects transport-neutral work-unit metadata from
each side exactly once per round, registers every work unit, and drives the
round. The default deployment uses `RaidenHandler`, but no coordinator,
worker protocol, or public result below contains a Raiden type or planner
option.

One round, in order:

    source                          destination
    ------                          -----------

                                      stop admitting, drain,
                                      free prefix + KV cache
    [handler.transfer]  --------->  (transport delivers the prepared weights)
                                    weight_sync()
                                      materialize into the STAGING copy only;
                                      record pending policy version
                                    post_weight_sync()
                                      atomically publish staging as serving,
                                      rebuild KV cache, resume admitting
    release_weight_sync()

On failure before any `weight_sync()` started, every destination that was asked
to prepare is told to `abort_weight_sync()`: discard staging, rebuild the KV
cache, resume serving the old weights.

The staging contract, and what it is NOT. Rollback is only possible because
`weight_sync()` MUST NOT touch the serving copy: publishing is
`post_weight_sync()`'s job and must be atomic per worker. This is a REQUIREMENT
on destination implementations, not something the transport does for them:
`h2d()` writes whatever arrays the synchronizer is currently bound to. Two
known ways a real destination can satisfy it: bind the synchronizer to a
dedicated staging array set and publish with an on-device copy, or use
`WeightSynchronizer.bind_weights()` (rebinds arrays in place, ports stable) to
ping-pong between two buffer sets with a pointer-swap publish. Until a real
McJAX destination passes two rounds under this contract on TPU, treat
multi-round ping-pong as unproven; the fakes here prove the coordinator,
nothing more.

Failure states are not collapsed, and neither are the two axes they live on.
Version consistency (who serves which policy version) and worker health (who is
serving at all) are separate dimensions; `WeightSyncResult.workers` carries the
per-worker record and `state` the round-level summary:

  ABORTED               rollback ran and every destination confirmed it.
  PARTIALLY_COMMITTED   some destinations published, others did not. Mixed
                        versions; no coordinator call can fix it.
  FAILED_NEEDS_RESTART  at least one destination could not be rolled back or
                        is in an unknown state; it may be stuck unserving.
  UNKNOWN_TRANSFER_STATE the transfer call timed out. The executor thread may
                        STILL BE WRITING into destination staging, so nothing
                        was aborted and source staging was NOT released;
                        anything else would destroy memory in use.

After any of the last three, the coordinator is poisoned: further `sync()`
calls raise until `reset_after_recovery()` is called, because starting a new
round against workers in unknown states can corrupt them further (or regress
policy versions).

Rounds are STRICTLY SYNCHRONOUS by design: rollout resumes only once the
serving fleet is on one policy version, so a round either publishes
everywhere or rolls back, and a split fleet is a failure rather than a mode.
That is what the current path needs, and it is the only setting in which the
per-worker records above mean what they say.

TODO(haochengd): support mixed-version serving as an opt-in alternative.
Letting fast destinations serve version N+1 while slow ones still serve N
removes the global barrier and the wait on the slowest worker, at the price
of off-policy rollouts. It is not a relaxation of the checks here but a
second consistency policy, and it needs all of: per-trajectory policy-version
tagging so the trainer can tell which policy produced a sample, an explicit
staleness bound (how many versions behind a destination may serve before it
is drained), a trainer-side contract for what to do with stale trajectories,
and a round state that reports a version spread instead of treating one as
PARTIALLY_COMMITTED. Until those exist, a split fleet stays a failure.

Worker-side contract: workers keep their current round keyed by the
(req_id, uuid) carried in `WeightSyncRequest.extra_config`, make every phase
idempotent for that key, reject phase calls carrying a stale key OR an
unknown key that cannot open a round (only a pre or an abort may), and report
their round through `get_weight_sync_status()`. `WorkerRoundTracker` in this
module implements exactly that and is what the fakes and the on-cluster mock
embed. The report is what the coordinator consults whenever a phase call
fails: an RPC error means "the reply is lost", not "the work did not happen".
One more obligation the tracker cannot carry for the worker: the coordinator
never issues overlapping phase calls for a live round, but a TIMED-OUT phase
RPC may still be executing when the rollback's abort arrives, so destinations
must serialize their phase bodies themselves (the on-cluster samplers hold an
asyncio.Lock across each phase).

This module sits after the worker lifecycle in `lifecycle.py`, it does not
replace it. `LifecycleDriver.bring_up` runs initialize -> compile -> start;
weight sync begins once workers are up and serving.

  resets the tracker only when it arrives as "prepared", the phase that opens
  a round, or as "aborted", which may outrun pre. A newer key arriving
  mid-round -- "h2d_done" or "committed" for a round this worker never opened --
  is refused without touching any state: taking it would move the high-water
  mark past the smaller round still legitimately on its way, and that round
  would then be rejected as stale forever on this worker.

  `complete` is separate from `admit` on purpose: a worker that crashes
  between doing the work and recording it will re-report the previous phase,
  the coordinator will retry, and the work must tolerate re-running. That is
  the crash-consistency window; hiding it inside one call would not close it.

  Thread safety: the tracker serializes its own state, because a remote
  execution server is not guaranteed to deliver phase RPCs on one thread. The
  phase WORK around it is the worker's to serialize -- a timed-out phase RPC
  can still be executing when the rollback's abort arrives, so destinations
  must hold their own lock across each phase body.

  Single-flight: a second `sync()` while one is in flight raises immediately.

  Poisoning: a round ending in PARTIALLY_COMMITTED, FAILED_NEEDS_RESTART, or

  unknown states compounds the damage and can regress policy versions.

  Round uuids are monotonic PER COORDINATOR INSTANCE. After a coordinator
  restart, construct with `first_uuid` greater than any uuid the fleet has
  seen (or restart the workers too); otherwise every worker's tracker
  rejects the new coordinator's rounds as stale.

  Transport-specific planner knobs are handler configuration rather than
  worker request data. The coordinator passes only stable work-unit ids, the
  round request id, and its monotonic generation.

  `AbstractRLEngine.sync_weights()` remains the outward-facing entry point;
  an engine implements it by calling `sync()` here and deciding what a raised

      "h2d_done"   the publish definitively did not happen; retry once
